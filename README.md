## What's Inside?

Each folder named after a specific technology contains a variety of small applications that I created to explore its functionality and understand its potential use cases.

## üìå Dependencies (if you want to run some applications yourself) üìå

Most importantly, you should have NODE and NPM installed 

* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) - Version: 10.8.3 or above
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/pt/download) - Version: 22.12.0 or above

Inside the folder of a project you'd like to see, simply:

```
node fileYoureTryingOut.js
```

Or, for bigger projects that uses frameworks or have package.json with dependencies named in it, run:

```
npm i
```
And after that:

```
npm run dev
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Be Advised

### Some applications might be broken, unfinished, in need of values on a .env to work or other very specific stuff that weren't mentioned here, so keep that in mind...
